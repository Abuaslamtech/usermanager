# Debugging Report for User Manager

## Issue Descriptions and Resolutions

### 1. Profile Image Not Displaying Correctly

**Description**:
Initially, user profile images were saved in `localStorage` as blob objects. This caused issues with displaying images correctly across sessions, as `localStorage` does not handle blobs efficiently.

**Solution**:
Converted the image blobs to base64 strings before saving to `localStorage`. This format is compatible with `localStorage` and ensures images load correctly when the app restarts.

**Outcome**:
Images now load properly across sessions, resolving the display issues.

### 2. Users List Not Updating After Deletion

**Description**:
After deleting a user, the list of users did not update automatically, requiring a manual page refresh to reflect changes.

**Solution**:
Utilized Reactâ€™s `useEffect` hook to listen for changes in the `users` state. When a user is deleted, `useEffect` re-renders the component to update the displayed user list.

**Outcome**:
The user list now updates automatically after deletion, providing a smoother user experience.

### 3. New User Data Overwriting Existing Data in LocalStorage

**Description**:
When saving a new user to `localStorage`, the existing data was overwritten, resulting in only one user being stored at a time.

**Solution**:
Modified the code to save users as an array in `localStorage`. Instead of replacing the entire array, the new user is appended to the existing array, and then the updated array is saved back to `localStorage`.

**Outcome**:
New users are now appended to the existing user list in `localStorage`, allowing multiple users to be stored and displayed correctly.

## Summary

These solutions improved the functionality of User Manager Pro by ensuring:

- Images load consistently by converting them to base64 strings.
- The user list updates automatically after deletion, improving usability.
- Multiple users are stored and retrieved correctly from `localStorage`, preventing data overwrites.
